Packaged well with fast shipping! Thank you! Very cool print. Traveled the long way here but worth the wait. Lior is cool. Item shipped quickly but was damaged through no fault of the Seller.

Will definitely shop here again! Very nice work and smooth transaction. Outstanding customer service & superior work! After scouring the internet & looking closely at all the samples, I selected WhimisicalLogoShop because I was most impressed with the details in each piece. The artist, Naj, worked painstakingly with me to capture each and every member of my family, including our pet. Not only was she extremely accommodating of all my numerous (and not always easy) requests, the turnaround time was amazing especially considering the amount of talent it takes to make something like this. This is a beautiful piece of art that my entire family will cherish. I am so grateful I chose this service. I gave this custom family portrait to my mom for her birthday, and she loves it! Seller is very quick in making edits. After the seller's first draft of the portrait, I only had to send her one email of my (extremely picky) edits. The next draft sent was perfect. Very talented work. I highly recommend this service for any special occasion gift. Seller is fast and gives you exactly what you want. I'm very happy with my purchase. Very good communication with client from artist. Unique product. Timely shipping. Highly recommend. I am super pleased with my finished product. Owner/artist was easy to work with, and met the deadline even with some issues beyond our control. She did edits fast and kindly, and was very professional along the way. I would purchase from her in the future and would recommend her to others. I'm planning to have one done for my sister next. Thanks so much, Naj! Love working with this shop! The portrait always comes out beautifully. Second time ordering from here and I will be back soon! So pretty. Thanks so much. It's a cute idea, not the products fault, just my ears. It doesn't quite fit 100%. Hubby helped bend them slightly to fit properly. Love my ear ring I will purchasing more. Beautiful and extraordinary ear jewellery. Will certainly order again. Beautiful, delicate, and well packaged! As described & no doubt classy. I hope my partner likes it as it's an Xmas pressie. I'm thrilled with my bangle! Just as beautiful as I hoped - and the packaging and notes/pin enclosed made it even more personal. Thank you so much! Even more beautiful than pictured. The bracelet was stunning!! I loved it so much. However I had to exchange it for a smaller size and in doing so exchanged it for a different floral pattern. She was super nice about the exchange and I received the new one very quickly. It was even more stunning than the first one. I loved it SO MUCH that I ordered another one in pink. I wear it everywhere and everyday!! I have received major compliments on it wherever I go. People stop me in the streets to have a closer look. I have never been happier with a purchase!! Excellent quality, workmanship, and style! Thank you! A very nice bracelet. Unfortunately, even the larger size will not allow my dragon claw to get through, so I will gift a pretty young girl. Thank you. Absolutely gorgeous necklace. I love it so much! And they sent a free enamel flower pin as a gift, and there were rose petals in the box! Could not have been a nicer experience! Thank you so much!!! My necklace is gorgeous!! It is so unique and a reminder to me of an item on my bucket list to see!! The packaging was wonderful with a heart and dried flowers inside what a sweet surprise. Thank you. Breathtaking! So beautiful in person. Love everything about this beautiful work of art. Lovingly packaged and the sparkle and lights effect is just right - subtle enough but very effective. Gorgeous!!! Absolutely stunning piece , it's a Christmas present and I know it will be loved . Was beautifully presented and I love the little pin too thank-you very much. Spectacular, if I never see the real thing I've got it captured in this necklace for always. Wonderfully packaged with loads of nice little extra touches. Buttonsy great to contact and kept in touch. This is just so pretty. The picture really doesn't do it justice. It arrived beautifully wrapped in a box. There was great communication from the seller and the item is beyond my expectations. Highly recommended!! Incredibly beautiful, the craftwoman has recaptured the spirit of an aurora borealis in that piece. I'm delighted and all the persons that see it around my neck are stunned by its beauty. A masterpiece! Just as pictured, though arrived late. Very happy with my purchase! wow- these necklaces are so sweet! love them! These are very VERY cute! So impressed they are handmade. Bought as a present and I know they are going to love them! Would be great to have an option to upgrade to a snake chain (just my preference). Excellent customer service after a package went missing. Would definitely recommend and will probably be back for more - thank you! An absolutely beautiful light. High quality in the manufacturing process , which is evident in the way the light fits together and the finish on the soft gold. Excellent customer service too !

Nice elegant lamp customfitted just for you, with good service! We love the custom-sized pillows so much! Great seller to work with! These pillows are gorgeous! Exceeded my expectations. The pictures don't really do it justice - the color is so vibrant. The only downside for me was the additional customs charges (I'm in the UK) --but that was expected. The quality is amazing and the person was a delight to deal with and made an extra effort to get me the pillows earlier than indicated and i am so aprpeciativ! Very beautiful! Excellent quality and design. So cute and a nice custom accent pillow! So many beautiful colors and design work . Excellent quality fabric and great customer care. What an awesome felt board !!!

Casual art that blends in but just lifts the whole feel of the room. it looks really cool above my bookshelf next to a dim lamp. i love how it's kind of ominous too. I love the colors and patterns in this print. It's going to look great on the wall of my new apartment! Even better than pictured - great print! Excellent - thank you so much! Such badass work; love it! It's just as expected and the patch is small. Only problem is is with tracking the item once purchased. Cuuuute! The patch looks absolutely incredible and the shop owner is super helpful. Thank you so much! Amazing patch, can't wait to add it to my jacket! Smaller than expected but super cute and perfect for denim. I am absolutely in love with this sketch. I was worried about its arrival, it had been some time and there are a number of days off in November, I contacted Charlotte and she reassured me almost immediately. It was definitely worth the money and the wait--more than worth it. It's insanely beautiful and well-made. Fantastic and a pleasure to communicate with. This mug was purchased as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves it. The form and colour are so pleasing. Fi has great communication and dispatched the item so quickly! This was an amazing mug. Perfect size for me. Something completely unique and different for a kitchen. Can't wait to go back and add to my set. So so pleased.

Purchased this as a Secret Santa gift which the recipient loved! Item is beautifully made and arrived in a lovely bag. It was wrapped and protected well for the shipping process. Great item! I do think this is a little expensive but as a special gift for someone it's worth it. The item itself is lovely, the writing is perfect and clear and it comes in a good quality, white drawstring bag which makes it for me. I think it's worth pointing out the dish is a decent size too. These are beautiful! I bought a set of four and they are each unique yet make a lovely set. They are masterfully crafted and I love the way they feel in my hand. Thank you for your amazing work! Love these hanging planters, so beautiful, thank you so much. Lovely item! Packaged very well and does the job great - nice to have a hand made tea strainer rather than a boring metal one.

Absolutely beautiful! Sam is so sweet and was able to get me exactly what I wanted. Will order from this shop again. I love the second looks I get on the Underground when I flash my phone around! Would like it a bit more protective of the screen though. Perfect! Looks fab! Great item, well packaged and fast delivery. Arrived well before I expected it! Fits snugly, very pretty and nice smooth rubber material - seems protective enough, luckily havent dropped it yet. This is amazing!! VERY quick delivery and the case itself is such good quality. Only downside is I'm very bad for picking at the side of my phone case, so I might need to order another one soon - but so far it's not damaged at all from my horrible habit. Thank you! Really lovely case and excellent customer service when there was a slight defect. Late review! The mousepads are pretty great! Shipping was out of our hands and took a little longer than expected but everything turned out A-Okay! Wonderful. Thank you very much! Really pretty! Perfect size as well. This looks fantastic on my desk. Loved it! Should've double checked the diameter before purchase though. It is very small. Arrived quickly and is an excellent size for my mouse and desk! Colours are wonderful too. Great quality! Absolutely love it. Quick shipping, great product! Very good quality and packaging. Arrived quickly. Would buy from this store again! Love this! It had the one thing that was most important for me that I couldn't find in other holiday planners! I cannot express enough how much we love this piece! The majority of our furniture and decorative pieces are mid century mod. We had started looking for art for our new place about a year ago - we kept coming back to this piece. I decided to spring for it, surprise my man, and is was SO WORTH IT. It took about 4 months from order to delivery. It is totally worth it!!! It is such a fantastic addition to our home. Quality and consistency are spot-on to the pictures. BETTER, actually. The depth, dimension, and craftsmanship are worth both time and money. Thank you so much for the time spent on this piece! It has fulfilled our vision of our home, and we are so happy to show it off to our friends and family! This is an absolutely wonderful piece of art. I love the detailed craftsmanship! It was carefully packaged and arrived quickly. Beautiful sculpture - better than expected. Really prompt communication from Yenny and received it in Asia with no trouble at all. Highly recommended. Got this for my husband as our first anniversary present, which is traditionally paper. It's so beautiful and special to us. Mei was amazing and her work is phenomenal!! Lovely card wallet - brought it for a Christmas gift exchange and it was a party favourite - most stolen gift of the game! This piece was absolutely amazing! Mei was so attentive to details that I hadn't even thought about. Got it as a gift for my friends, and they really, really loved it! I absolutely loved this freestanding plaque that I purchased for my sister as a wedding gift. The order came exactly when expected and I received regular updates. Thank you so much to Ruby and those involved in the making! This is the second time I've ordered from here and have been very pleased both times. Will definitely recommend to others!! Looks beautiful! Gets a ton of compliments! This item exceeded my expectations, I bought it as a gift for someone, but when I received it I had a hard job parting with it, I wanted to keep it for myself. This brooch is absolutely gorgeous, I want to keep it! But it's a present for my pagan mum who really needs some pampering this Christmas. I know she'll love it. I would have purchased the copper but it was out of stock, but glad in a way, because the bronze has a lovely red-ish sheen to it anyway, and it's gives the whole gorgeous brooch a glowing effect. It's fabulous, was wrapped well and is super light too! Thank you Kirsty, and for keeping in touch throughout the process. You've been a joy to purchase from. If you see something you like in her store, buy without hesitation. You won't regret it! I love it, not sure what the couple think yet as thry have yet to reply to all their gifts received. However the seller was amazing. She got an extra figure of the sailor for me and the extra requirements. Fantastic vendor, brilliant service. Absolutely lovely gift for a friends wedding, thank you! Excellent customer service too, listened to what I wanted and changed things if needed. Would 100% recommend! Thank you again! So helpful and the finished picture is fab!!! Will definitely be ordering again!! Nicola was so helpful and made my frame exactly the way I wanted it. She kept in touch with me throughout the planning process and shipped it as soon as it was ready. Made the whole thing smooth and easy. Would definitely recommend!! So pleased with our frame, which I'm sure the bride and groom will love! Nicola was so helpful and quick to come back me, even though I asked for such a quick turn around. Great communication. Picture is fantastic and customised just as we asked! Thank you! Great communication to get exactly the right thing i was looking for. quick delivery. Friends loved it! Thank you! This was a great gift and was made super quick for us so I could give on time. I'd recommend it to everyone as a lovely, novel present. Thanks again. Fantastic handmade item. Slight issue with postage that was handled and resolved extremely quickly and in a professional manner so I am very happy. Thank you again. Lovely perfect size and looks great. Bought for Golden Wedding Anniversary and didn't disappoint. Item arrived extremely well packaged. Now displayed,provides a very unique memento of a very special occasion. Very beautiful and unique tree! Love this sooooo much, perfect present, well made and delicate. Lovely packaging too. Exquisite piece of art, looks even better in real life. Made a great gift!

A wonderful shop to explore! I'm so happy with my purchases! A+++ I was worried it'd be too big to fit nicely on a desk or shelf, but the size is perfect in my opinion. A sturdy piece and looks great. This was super beautiful! I love the way it was painted and it came in wonderfully and safely packaged. The perfect size. Friend loved this. A very unique gift, and really great quality! One of THE BEST geek purchases I have ever made. As soon as I got it out of the box I couldn't stop admiring it, and for the price such a steal!!! This ware is most definitely worth the coin. Now this is an awesome little stone. Shipped fast, well packaged, and very nice. Beautiful specimen. These might be a little big to be called pebbles but are nice just the same. Again, fast shipping, well packaged, and just as advertised. Beautiful ring. Very dainty, lovely shade of gold (not too yellow) - I wear it everyday! Great value for money! Will return to this shop for sure. Gorgeous, sparkly, dainty ring. Exactly as described. Thank you. I couldn't be happier with this bracelet. It looks even better in real life and is just perfect. The quality is amazing and the chain has two O-rings so you can adjust the size. Love my wedding band! It compliments my engagement ring as the thinness is the same. Love the dainty look and the small diamonds. Very happy that 18k yellow gold was available. Thank you! Well-crafted and great design. Prompt delivery. Beautifully crafted ring. Prompt communication. This ring is so precious - it's tiny and the diamonds sparkle so bright that it makes you smile. Elegant Jewel Box is amazing. Thank you. This is a very classy business from the beautiful items they make to the way they deal with their customers. I am very impressed and I will be back to buy more in the future. Came perfectly! In just 8 business days to the US during the holidays. Packaged very nicely with a cute little gift bag!! I ordered a dusty rose chunky blanket for my daughters new apartment. It arrived just in time for Christmas. The color is perfect! Not too pink. The quality of the yarn and workmanship are excellent. Recipient loved the item.

Simply beautiful products. Prompt correspondence from shop and requests all met. Would definately recommend and buy again. The spoons that I ordered are slightly smaller than American teaspoon. They were done perfectly, are very sweet and the gift wrapping was worth it. Thank you! Such a fab present, especially for those who can't eat all those modern day sweets with lots of chemicals and e-numbers. Now my Dad will feel part of Christmas and can munch treats with us!!! THANK YOU! Lovely illustrations! Second time ordering. Huge fan of your work x. I bought this for my sister in-law and I want to keep it. It is adorable. I will be ordering another.  Wonderful - I always wanted a bag like this - and finally I own one - Thank you very much. This bag is amazing, and a beautiful simulacrum. It looks just like a brown paper shopping bag but is high quality materials and will last for a long, long time. I can't wait to buy more to give away as gifts. Will buy again! Really great bag. Thank you! I am so very pleased with this Canvas Market Bag! So many of my friends have made comments about it already, and it got here in no time flat! I will definitely be returning to this shop! I'm a big fan of eco friendly, reusable items made to replicate their disposable counterparts, and this Market bag does not disappoint! I'd gotten the lunch bag quite a while ago, and love it- these bags are high quality, durable, and only get more interesting with age and wear. I love them! I saved my mad money up to get this chic grocery bag, because an investment in quality, local handmade is so, so worth it. Will definitely buy again! Love it! Thank you! Thank you so much, I love it!
